# HowManyLabs
How many baby labs are there?

Let's use ICIS authorship as a proxy for how many baby labs there are in the world, and email domains for lab groupings. I extracted the author emails from ICIS2012 and ICIS2014 and counted domain names, dropping obvious non-academic domains (Google, Yahoo).  

There are 840 unique domains over these two years. Unsurprisingly the counts are power-law distributed. 

Two potential issues with the long tail: (1) typos and (2) some authors don't come from labs that mainly study babies (e.g. a stats collaborator).  Let's assume that re-attendance (one person attended in 2 years) and multiple attendance (multiple people in 1 year) both suggest that you're more likely a 'real' babylab. 

Examining the body of the distribution:

All: 840
Labs > 1: 468
Labs > 2: 330
Labs > 3: 250
